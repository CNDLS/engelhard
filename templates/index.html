        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p class="lead">Embodying Georgetown’s mission of <em>cura personalis</em>, and exemplifying the kind of high-impact learning practice that characterizes a Georgetown education, the Engelhard Project represents an innovative approach to integrating student well-being issues into academic contexts.</p>
        <p>The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning focuses on teaching to the whole student. By incorporating health and well-being issues into the classroom, the Project enhances academic learning, encourages students to reflect on their own attitudes and behaviors, and fosters connections both in and out of the classroom.</p>
        <p>Using a <b>curriculum infusion</b> approach, Georgetown faculty link academic course content to health and well-being topics through readings, presentations, discussions led by campus health professionals, and reflective writing assignments. In addition, fitting with Georgetown's commitment to social justice, some courses extend this work with involvement in local communities. The project strives to create meaningful connections between faculty, students, and campus resource professionals and encourages the practice of one of Georgetown's most important Jesuit principles, <em>cura personalis</em>, or care for the person.</p>
        <p>The Engelhard Project is made possible by an endowment from the Charles Engelhard Foundation, with additional support from alumni and parents.</p>

        <h2>Impact Over the Years</h2>
        <p class="lead">What began as a curricular experiment has evolved into one of the hallmarks of a Georgetown undergraduate education, reaching thousands of students across campus. Since 2005, the Engelhard Project has offered <b>nearly 500 courses</b> taught by <b>over 100</b> faculty members, for a combined enrollment of <b>more than 19,200 students</b>.</p>
        
        <p>The Engelhard Project has forged strong connections among faculty, student affairs staff, and students, not only enriching the Georgetown experience but also engaging in national conversations about the role of well-being in higher education. The Project's work has been shared formally and informally through conversations across campus, in academic journal articles, at national higher education conferences, and with a presentation by President DeGioia at a 2013 White House Conference on mental health.</p>

        <blockquote style="font-family: cursive">“If only all courses could prove to be so relevant to my personal and educational growth. This class is truly reflective of what all courses in college ought to be.” - Engelhard Student</blockquote>
