				<h2>The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning</h2>
				<p class="lead">
					Embodying Georgetown’s mission of cura personalis, and exemplifying the kind of high-impact learning practice that characterizes a Georgetown education, the Engelhard Project represents an innovative approach to integrating student well-being issues into academic contexts.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning builds on the principles of whole person education by supporting faculty and campus resource professionals as partners in incorporating health and well-being issues into the classroom. This curricular approach enhances academic learning, encourages students to reflect on their own attitudes and behaviors, and fosters faculty, staff, and student connections both in and out of the classroom that support students’ engagement in their learning.
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					If you’d like to get involved in the Project, please explore more about <a style="color: #0071a1;" href="{{ url_for('page', path='engelhard-courses') }}">Engelhard courses here</a> and consider <a style="color: #0071a1;" href="https://forms.gle/48aGhuvdvKudCmof9" target="__blank">proposing an Engelhard course</a> you would like to offer, or check out other opportunities to join the Project through grants or Conversation groups. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with your ideas and/or questions!
				</p>
				<p class="lead">
					The Engelhard Project is made possible by an endowment from the Charles Engelhard Foundation, with additional support from alumni and parents.
