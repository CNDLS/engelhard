title: Engelhard Courses

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p class="lead"> Engelhard courses are the signature element of the Engelhard Project. Using a curriculum infusion approach, Georgetown
      faculty link academic course content to health and well-being topics through readings, presentations, discussions led
      by campus health professionals, and reflective writing assignments. In addition, fitting with Georgetown's commitment
      to social justice, some courses extend this work with involvement in local communities. The Project strives to create
      meaningful connections between faculty, students, and campus resource professionals and encourages the practice of
      one of Georgetown's most important Jesuit principles,
      <em>cura personalis</em>, or care of the person. </p>
    <p> Each semester, faculty from about 40 undergraduate courses apply to participate as “Engelhard Faculty Fellows" and work
      to integrate a particular issue of well-being into their courses in partnership with staff across campus (in centers
      such as Counseling and Psychiatric Services, Health Education Services, the LGBTQ Resource Center, etc.). Faculty Fellows
      are encouraged to be creative in how they incorporate their health topic of choice into their Engelhard course. This
      means each Engelhard course is
      unique. For examples of Engelhard courses, check out our <a href="{{ url_for('page', path='profiles') }}">course profiles page</a>. </p>

    <h3>Requirements of the Engelhard Faculty Fellowship:</h3>
    <p>All Georgetown faculty are eligible to particpate in Engelhard courses. As an Engelhard Faculty Fellow, it is our understanding
      that, at a minimum, you will design a module related to student well-being to be integrated into your undergraduate
      course. Implementation of the module should include:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:medium">
      <li>a course-related reading;</li>
      <li>a one-session in-class visit by a GU resource professional (such as staff from CAPS, Health Education Services, LGBTQ
        Center, Student Health Center, or Women’s Center) to discuss the topic; and </li>
      <li>a written reflection by students based on a writing prompt provided by the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All Engelhard Faculty Fellows will be required to submit a course proposal form and a copy of their course syllabus.
      Fellows are also asked to participate in a one-time, 2-hour Campus Safety Net Training co-hosted by Student Affairs
      (offered in early fall and early spring).</p>
    <p>Finally, Faculty Fellows are asked to assess the effects of curriculum infusion in their course. This includes:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:medium">
      <li>collecting and sharing copies of your students’ written reflections with the Engelhard team (can be anonymous);</li>
      <li>asking students to respond to a brief anonymous end-of-semester online survey administered by CNDLS;</li>
      <li>either participating in a faculty group reflection meeting at the end of the semester to provide feedback on the fellowship
        experience OR submitting a one-page faculty reflection describing development of the curriculum infusion module,
        results of implementation, and your impression of your students’ experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Funding</h3>
    <p> Engelhard Faculty Fellows will receive a stipend ranging from $250-500 (determined by class size and course design).
      Additionally, the project can provide a small stipend if you have a TA involved in your course as an Engelhard Teaching
      Assistant Fellow.</p>
    <h3>Proposal Process</h3>

      the development of the module with a well-being link to the curricular content of the course.</p>
