          <p class="lead">For Engelhard courses, the curriculum infusion approach involves finding opportunities within the regular academic content of the course where topics of mental health, wellness, and student well-being can be highlighted, linked to course content, and also considered from a personal perspective. This is done through:</p>
          <ul class="lead" style="font-size: 17px">
          <li>Targeted readings or assignments that open up the connections between the academic content and well-being topic(s);</li>
          <li>In-class opportunities to learn more about the topic and to make personal connections to lived experience through class discussion and a guest presentation from a campus resource professional; and</li>
          <li>A reflective writing assignment based on the infusion topic.</li>
