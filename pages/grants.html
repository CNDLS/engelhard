title: Engelhard Grants

<div>
	<p class="lead">
		Engelhard course grants support class-related activities that strengthen a culture of well-being in courses across Georgetown.
	</p>
	<p>
		Engelhard course grants are intended to help faculty and students take advantage of the resources of the larger community, bringing the curricular and co-curricular together in order to give students a space to bridge salient wellbeing issues on campus with the rich academic content of their coursework.
	</p>
	<p>
		Events or activities funded by these grants could include guest speakers, wellness activities, field trips, materials that support health and well-being, or activities designed to foster attention to well-being—physical, mental, spiritual, or otherwise—both within and outside of the classroom, extending students' understanding of course material and how it relates to their larger life experiences. <em>The current grant cycle has ended for the Spring 2020 semester. Further information will be shared as it becomes available.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>We invite research project proposals from faculty and staff working within the Project to explore the impacts of their Engelhard course(s).</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Proposed projects can focus on student well-being, student learning, faculty experience, teaching and learning, campus community, or any Engelhard-related goal of your course. Preference will be given to proposals from interdisciplinary and/or cross-campus groups that could include faculty, campus resource fellows, and/or students. We are especially interested in Engelhard Faculty Fellows and Engelhard Campus Resource Fellows who apply together.
