Engelhard Course Components
---

As Engelhard Faculty Fellows, faculty members create space in a course for connections between regular course content and a health and wellness topic that is relevant to students' lives. The implementation of the Engelhard component varies quite a bit from course to course, but each Engelhard course includes these elements:

* Targeted readings or assignments that link the academic course content with the chosen wellness topic;
* In-class opportunities to learn more about the topic and to make personal connections through a guest presentation and class discussion; and
* A reflective writing assignment (which can be ungraded) based on the Engelhard topic.
