  <h4>Faculty</h4>
      <p class="lead">Engelhard faculty fellows use a curriculum infusion approach to link academic course content to health and well-being topics through readings, presentations, discussions led by campus health professionals, and reflective writing assignments. To view examples of past course collaborations and thematic topics, visit our <a href="/profiles">Course Profiles </a>page.</p>
