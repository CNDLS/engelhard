<h4>Considering Engelhard</h4>
<p>When I started in the Human Science department, Joan Riley (co-lead of the Engelhard Project), was straight across the hallway. I learned about the program fairly early on, being a part of the department. 
Though I loved the idea of Engelhard, it took me a while to figure out how to use it in my classes. Because I’m a basic scientist, and because all the courses I’ve taught at the university level have been very “hard science,” the idea of integrating wellness subject matter into the material was always a bit of a conundrum. My understanding of the Engelhard Project was this fusion: an integration of student health / mental health issues that are directly relevant to students’ lives today into the classroom with the course material. This was always the challenge for me. How do I do that in a fairly introductory-level, basic science course? In a course where we are not talking specifically about the science of mental health, but about molecules?</p>
<p>As I attended various Engelhard Community of Practice gatherings with faculty colleagues and began listening to how other science educators on campus participated in the Engelhard Project, I noticed a few of those individuals were in neurobiology.  [Reader’s Note: Community of Practice meetings are gatherings of Engelhard faculty fellows and health professionals to discuss different topics on campus of concern for students.] They tackled such issues as the science of disease in the brain, applying topical content that deals with psychoactive drugs. From there, it was quite an easy segue into the science of anxiety and depression and their treatment. I thought, “I have topics about the transport of ions across membranes. All of the receptors that are targets for these psychoactive drugs are channels in membranes. And since I'm talking about channels, perhaps it would fit!”</p>
<p>The [Engelhard] topic I chose was “test anxiety.” We talked about the literature around coping mechanisms, about realizing what is a healthy amount of anxiety and what it takes to know one's limit. We thought it was a good topic for this cohort [of students] in particular because they were second-semester sophomores. Practically 90% of them were following a pre-med track. As sophomores, they take my course [Molecular and Cellular Fundamentals of Health & Disease] concurrently with Organic Chemistry II... They are in a somewhat fragile mental state. It's hard; they get caught up in the anxiety and they don't do so well. It's a difficult semester [for these students] on many fronts. 
Joan Riley put me in contact with Matt Schottland [CAPS psychologist]. When Matt and I talked, we arrived at a word—a concept—that became the [Engelhard] topic: “mindfulness.” We talked about mindfulness exercises we could get the students to complete in the classroom. Because their anxiety is high, I loved the idea of giving them this kind of experience in the classroom: giving them exercises and methods for talking about what mindfulness is. For the last couple of years, Spring of 2015 and 2016, Matt and I have done the course differently. We've listened to different types of music; we’ve done various types of meditation. He's also done this new “craisin exercise” in which we give each student a craisin and force them to [slow down and] touch it, feel it—it’s this long period of time in which you're supposed to have the craisin in your mouth. He calls it "mindful eating," which, in my daily life, I don't do at all. I tell the students as well: I’m just like them, I know that I don’t take the time to reflect on these everyday practices. When we force them to reflect, they realize, "Oh, I haven't paused at all. I don't do this!" Even after the 45 minutes we spend on it in class, they feel the impact. That's why it works; we're actually forcing them to pause and think.</p>
<p>I've noticed historically that the reason why Engelhard is so good for this course is because it occurs at the perfect time for [the students]. Often they are very medically focused and are high-achieving. Their coping mechanisms with regard to handling anxiety are good; they can perform well under stress or else they wouldn't be on this path. [But] what they lack is the experience, because they've perhaps never been pushed to a limit. This is the semester where it happens to them; it's where that line is: the amount of stress I know I can handle vs. "I should go talk to someone about my issues, I'm not sleeping, I'm not eating, etc."—or when it goes over the invisible line into pathological anxiety. I try to relate this distinction to the students, because they think they are indestructible. The students need to know about resources available to them at CAPS (Counseling and Psychiatric Services). They need to talk about, for example, anxiety. What's a healthy amount of anxiety and what's not?</p>

It seemed like a natural thing for me to do. Because my spring semester class is fairly small, I get to know my students fairly well over the course of the semester. The positive feedback I get from the students at the end of the year is less because I'm an amazing instructor and more to the credit of a different kind of attitude in teaching. I don't think I'm any better at explaining this material than my colleagues are. However, being in lab with them in smaller groups and making the effort to know them better, makes things better. Engelhard allows for these interactions to take place among larger groups of students.</p>
