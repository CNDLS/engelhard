professor: Jen Luettel Schweer
title: Director of the Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Team
course: "Relationship Violence & Sexual Assault: A US Perspective"
department: Women & Gender Studies
quote: "I'm a fan of the Engelhard model and the wellness component in all ways, on both the teaching side and being a part of that as a health professional."


“The content is really hard,” says Professor Jen Schweer. “There are a lot of things that can come up with students when talking about and processing this content.” The content of her course, titled Relationship violence & Sexual Assault: A US Perspective, is covered in weekly sessions of two and half hours, which some of her students may view as a daunting time allotment devoted to intense discussion.
 Prof. Schweer is also a Campus Resource Professional (CRP). As a CRP, she conducts facilitations for other Engelhard courses that have mental wellbeing topics aligned with her area of expertise. Prof. Schweer says that a big part in ensuring the success of an Engelhard unit from the role of a Campus Resource Professional (CRP) is working closely with professors in advance to learn about the culture of the course and how the CRP’s content and pedagogy strategies can be adjusted to fit within that classroom culture. “It’s not really about how I come in and frame it,”, Professor Schweer says. “It’s about learning what tools and techniques can be an additional support.”
For Professor Schweer, the benefits of working with Engelhard are three-fold: she not only gets to create a safe, supportive, and transformative space for students as a professor of an Engelhard course, but she also gets to reap the benefits of being a part of a faculty community, in addition to serving other Engelhard courses as a CRP. She says, “The benefits of it really do just keep coming, and not just for the students, but also for those of us who have the privilege of being a part of it.”
