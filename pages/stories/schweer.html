“The material we cover in class can be really difficult,” says Professor Jen Schweer. “There are
so many things that can come up for students when talking about and processing this topic.”
The content of her course, titled Relationship Violence &amp; Sexual Assault: A US Perspective, is
covered in weekly sessions of two and half hours, which some may view as a daunting time
allotment devoted to intense discussion. But it’s her skilful integration of wellbeing topics and
inclusive pedagogy into the course curriculum - a skill that she’s cultivated through several
years as an Engelhard Faculty Fellow - that is meant to leave students hopeful and energized
around this issue at the end of the course.
Prof. Schweer is also a Campus Resource Professional (CRP). When she’s not teaching her
own Engelhard course, she serves as a CRP where she facilitates sessions for other Engelhard
courses where mental wellbeing topics are aligned with her area of expertise. Prof. Schweer
says that a big part of ensuring the success of an Engelhard unit from the role of a CRP is
working closely with professors in advance to learn about the culture of the course and how the
CRP’s content and pedagogical strategies can be adjusted to fit within that culture. “It’s
important to frame it in a way that connects with the class and course materials,” Professor
Schweer says. “That happens through learning what kind of content, tools and techniques can
support the goals of the course and while also introducing new information/materials to
students.”

For Professor Schweer, there are multiple benefits of working with Engelhard in these distinct
capacities: she not only gets to help create a safe, supportive, and transformative space for
students as a professor of an Engelhard course, but she also reaps the benefits of being a part
of an engaged community of Engelhard Faculty Fellows. Additionally, helping facilitate other
Engelhard courses as a CRP allows her to connect her day to day work and expertise with
content in the classroom, allowing students to see the real-world application of mental health
and wellness topics in places they don’t necessarily expect . She says, “The benefits of it really
do just keep coming, and not just for the students, but also for those of us who have the
privilege of being a part of this innovative project.”
