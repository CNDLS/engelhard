quote: “To really have a community, we need to foster an environment where different challenges can be recognized.”

In Professor Sylvia Onder’s Disability & Culture Engelhard course, she aimed to restore the meaning of the word “care”—she expresses that the word has turned into a platitude, and that work needs to be done to redefine what care looks like in the classroom, particularly for those who identify as disabled.
Prof. Onder deeply considered the instructional design of her Engelhard course, developing ways to lower stakes for assignments, encourage collaboration, and allow students to engage in activity-based learning. This pedagogical change, in tandem with the Engelhard module, had a profound impact on student learning outcomes and morale. Prof. Onder was also greatly impacted as an Engelhard instructor, and she issues a charge to Georgetown faculty – specifically male professors – to infuse course content with topics of wellbeing. “I really appreciate the Engelhard project and I recommend it to other faculty,” says Prof. Onder. “I think it would be terrific to have more male professors do Engelhard. It seems that there’s a bit of an artificial divide, and it tends to skew female. It puts a burden on female professionals to be the only ones who care, and if we’re the only ones who care, we also get asked [more frequently] for letters of recommendations and to tend to crisis situations. So, I think it would be terrific to have more male faculty do Engelhard classes to show that they also care about student wellbeing.”
