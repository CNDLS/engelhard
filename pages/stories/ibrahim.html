quote: “Getting [students] to do creative activities in class to engage with this question of, ‘who are you as a gendered being,’ ‘who are you as a cultural being,’ really got them to open up about mental health.”

Professor Amrita Ibrahim turned both of her Fall 2020 Intro to Cultural Anthropology sections into Engelhard courses, with the goal of developing first and second-year students’ understanding of themselves as gendered, sexual, and cultural beings. Realizing that undergoing this slow process is difficult for most students, she goes far beyond the one-session Engelhard facilitation conducted by campus resource professionals Brit Engin and Egan Ontiveros. With the help of CNDLS, Professor Ibrahim transformed the instructional design of her course—this included waiving harsh deadlines for most assignments and replacing a final paper with a final creative project where students created a collage that reflected their gender and sexual expression. One of the main revelations by students as a result of the course was that they each have their own culture aside from “just being American.” Engelhard was integral in providing the framing necessary to have these conversations about aspects of identity that many incoming students are reluctant to speak openly about.
In addition to the adaptations to learning engagements, there was also an intentional shift in the social interactions that Professor Ibrahim had with her students. She says that during the pandemic, she entered her courses with the assumption that “no one is doing well, because whatever the transition had been for individuals, this transition had been a moment of extreme anxiety, grit, [and] uncertainty.” Even when not amid a pandemic, students experience their own traumas in their everyday lives. According to Professor Ibrahim, conducting frequent check-ins with students “puts more responsibility on the professors.” However, doing so helped students open up about what they needed from her and the course.
