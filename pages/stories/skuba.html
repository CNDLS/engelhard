“Competitiveness doesn’t sound like a health and wellness topic, but truthfully, I believe it is very
much one,” says Professor Charles Skuba, the instructor of the First Year Seminar titled
Patterns of Global Commerce. Perhaps many of Professor Skuba’s first-year students would
have agreed with the first part of his statement when they began the course which focuses on
the competitiveness of communities, nations, and individuals.. However, thanks to the
Engelhard intervention, students were taught to be aware of the “grind culture” that is pervasive
in corporate America, particularly in finance and consulting, and global business more broadly.
Specifically, the course explored questions such as, “what kind of environment should a
company establish for its workers?”, and “how do [students] see themselves fitting into that?”
Professor Skuba shares this message with faculty who are hesitant about adding an Engelhard
component with their course: “When I first started teaching my course as a part of the Engelhard
program, I was skeptical about whether it would fit, because the course is complex,it integrates
a lot of content and there&#39;s a lot of synthesis in it already. Now, however, I&#39;m realizing it actually
does fit in quite well. I believe there was a student need and appreciation for it.” “In the 2021
class, I’ve been moved by the deep introspection about what it means to be happy in your work
and in your life that this has stirred among the class.”
