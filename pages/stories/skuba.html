“Competitiveness doesn’t sound like a health and wellness topic, but truthfully, I believe it is one,” says Professor Charles Skuba, the instructor of the First Year Seminar titled Competitiveness in a Global Environment. Perhaps many of the first-year students would have agreed with the first part of Professor Skuba’s statement when they began the course. However, thanks to the Engelhard intervention, students were taught to be aware of the “grind culture” that is pervasive in corporate America and global business more broadly. Specifically, the course explored questions such as, “what kind of environment should a company establish for its workers?”, and “how do [students] see themselves fitting into that?”
Professor Skuba shares this message with faculty who are hesitant about adding an Engelhard component with their course: “When I first started teaching my course as a part of the Engelhard program, I was skeptical about whether it would fit, because the course is complex, it's integrated, there's a lot of synthesis in it already […] and increasingly I'm realizing it actually does fit in quite well. I believe there was a student need and appreciation for it.”
