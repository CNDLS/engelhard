        For over ten years, the Engelhard Project has been changing lives and building community on Georgetown’s campus. From faculty to students and campus professionals, each member of the Engelhard commmunity has a story to tell and experience to share. Some of these "Engelhard voices" are captured below.

<div class="col-md-8">
<p>“Within an Engelhard course, you see a transformation in yourself. I think it's similar for the students. There are transformations in me—in realizing that [my students] are these very wonderful individuals who are very complex and that I need to appreciate what they're going through. No one appreciated what I was going through—or at least I felt that way when I was in school. I realized that connection was going to be key - not just for me to enjoy being with the students but for my students to benefit from the course's Engelhard's well-being components and for us to be able to understand these concepts of complex synaptic transmission together.” <i> - Kathy Maguire-Zeiss, Neuroscience</i></p>

<p>“I feel that because we bring health care professionals to the class, it lets [students] see that their professor cares about them as a whole person. I’m getting all sorts of interesting interaction with the students, and I feel that it has been facilitated by Engelhard. It makes [my students] realize, ‘Oh, she’s not just teaching me this material, she wants me to think about me. So I can come and talk to her about my life!’ I get to hear experiences I would not get to hear were it not for this Engelhard component.” <i> - Rhonda Dzakpasu, Physics</i></p>

<p>“I want the students to trust me. I want them to know there is someone they can trust. I’m not out to make anyone suffer. The evaluations I get from students will sometimes say ‘Professor Stiles cares about me as a person.’ I saw a Maya Angelou quote recently: 'They won’t remember what you said, they won’t remember what you did, but they will remember how you made them feel.' I want people to feel excited about learning, excited about being with other people, and excited about what their vocation is going to be in this beautiful, broken world. Too often, the world just seems broken, but it’s beautiful too. But when I learned the extent of the suffering of the students, I began to feel like I was on a mission - a mission to help them perform at their best.“ <i>- Sarah Stiles, Sociology</i></p>

<div class="col-md-9">
<p>“Engelhard has shown me, especially through the Community of Practice meetings that we have, the ways that other faculty connect with their students, which in turn made me figure out how to connect with my own students. On my end, it´s wonderful. When I teach now, I’m not just somebody who’s throwing information out; I feel like I’m a part of their life. This week I’ve already had coffee with three former students who return to visit campus. This is what makes me excited to go to work in the morning. When I look back on my day at the end of the day, it used to be about how much data I personally got from our lab, for example. Now, these new things bubble up; I remember the times when I’ve had an interaction with a student that may or may not have helped them.
<br>
<br>
People will always say, ‘Oh, Engelhard´s really great for the students.’ But I think it's also important for the faculty. After a few years, the students leave, and we stay. It’s nice to have this program that can help them, but that also transforms us. I thought I was too old to be transformed into anything. I thought, 'I’ve already been established. I’ve done all my own stuff for a really long time.' It was a surprising growth experience as an adult. It makes me look back and think on what kind of person was I before. It helped me to bring out the positive qualities that I could contribute that I didn’t quite think I could contribute anymore. It tears me up because I get very empowered. It empowers faculty. I don’t know if that was necessarily the goal of Engelhard, but for me, it really makes a big difference. Now I love to teach.“ <i>- Kathy Maguire-Zeiss, Neuroscience</i></p>
