        <p class="lead">For Engelhard courses, the curriculum infusion approach involves finding opportunities within the regular academic content of the course where topics of mental health, wellness, and student well-being can be highlighted, linked to course content, and also considered from a personal perspective. This is done through:</p>
        <ul class="lead" style="font-size: 17px">
        <li>Targeted readings or assignments that open up the connections between the academic content and well-being topic(s);</li>
        <li>In-class opportunities to learn more about the topic and to make personal connections to lived experience through class discussion and a guest presentation from a campus resource professional; and</li>
        <li>A reflective writing assignment based on the infusion topic.</li>
        </ul> </article>

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
        As Engelhard Faculty Fellows, faculty members create space in a course for connections between regular course content and a mental health and/or well-being topic that is relevant to students' lives. Engelhard Faculty Fellows then work with Campus Resource Professional Fellows to incorporate a presentation and/or discussion on the chosen well-being topic, in conjunction with class readings. In addition, Engelhard Fellows are part of a larger community, establishing connections with colleagues through project gatherings, including a Safety Net Training which provides an overview of campus student health resources. Both Faculty and Campus Resource Professional Fellows receive a stipend for their participation and additional funding is available for teaching assistants.

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
      The exact topic(s) and form of curriculum infusion in a given Engelhard course are determined by the faculty member, and depend on the needs of that particular course and its students. While the project team at CNDLS is always happy to consult with faculty to discuss ideas for possible approaches, ultimately each faculty member determines a course’s Engelhard design. The connection between course material and the well-being issue creates an opportunity for faculty to deepen student engagement in a variety of ways. For example, if a course involves teaching statistical models, the faculty may decide to tailor a data set involved in an analysis to address a specific well-being issue. Or if it is a literature course, the faculty may decide to link concepts or characters from reading assignments to real-life well-being issues.

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
      While there is a wide range of well-being topics, previous Engelhard courses have addressed: adjustment and transition to college, anxiety, coping mechanisms, depression, eating disorders, emotional intelligence, healthy relationships, mindfulness, mood regulation, self-forgiveness, sexual identity, sexual violence, sleep deprivation, substance abuse, suicide, and stress, among others. For more examples, visit our <a href="/profiles">Course Profiles</a> page. In determining the best fit for their course, faculty are encouraged to think about well-being topics that naturally connect with their course material and aspects of students’ lived experiences.

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
      The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning began in 2005, supported by a grant from the <a href="http://www.bttop.org/">Bringing Theory to Practice</a> (BTtoP) Project, awarded to a group of Georgetown faculty and student affairs staff. This group was interested in exploring — and making explicit — connections between students' academic studies and their broader life experiences, especially in the areas of well-being, flourishing, and mental health. Implementing the innovative curriculum infusion approach, the Project took hold at Georgetown. After the first few years with BTtoP grant support, the Project was endowed through a generous gift from the Charles Engelhard Foundation in 2012. Today, the Engelhard Project has worked with 100+ faculty and 50+ campus resource professionals on nearly 500 courses, with a combined student enrollment of over 19,200. The Engelhard Project is grateful for the support over the years from BTtoP and its co-founder, Sally Engelhard Pingree, as well as the support the project has received from additional donors and the University.
