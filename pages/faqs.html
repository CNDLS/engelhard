        <p class="lead">For Engelhard courses, the curriculum infusion approach involves finding opportunities within the regular academic content of the course where topics of mental health, wellness and student well-being can be highlighted, linked to course content, and also considered from a personal perspective. This is done through the following elements:</p>
        <ul class="lead" style="font-size: 17px">
        <li>Targeted readings or assignments that open up the connection between the academic content and well-being topic(s);</li>
        <li>In-class opportunities to learn more about the topic and to make personal connections to lived experience through class discussion and a guest presentation from a campus resource professional; and</li>
        <li>A reflective writing assignment based on the infusion topic.</li>
        </ul> </article>

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
        As Engelhard Faculty Fellows, faculty members create space in a course for connections between regular course content and a mental health and/or well-being topic that is relevant to students' lives. Engelhard Faculty Fellows then work with Campus Resource Professional Fellows to incorporate a presentation and/or discussion on the chosen well-being topic for the course, in conjunction with class readings. In addition, Engelhard Fellows participate in project meetings and assessments, including a Safety Net Training, which provides an overview of campus student health resources. Both Faculty and Campus Resource Professional Fellows receive a stipend for their participation and can also request additional funding for teaching assistants.

      The exact topic(s) and form of curriculum infusion in a given Engelhard course will depend on the needs of that particular course and its students. For example, if a course involves teaching statistical models, the faculty may decide to tailor a data set involved in an analysis to address a specific well-being issue. Or if it is a literature course, the faculty may decide to link concepts or characters from reading assignments to real-life well-being issues. The connection between course material and the well-being issue creates an opportunity for faculty to deepen student engagement in a variety of ways. The project team at CNDLS is always happy to consult with faculty to discuss and develop ideas together for possible approaches.

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
      Faculty are encouraged to think about well-being topics that can might naturally connect with their course material and aspect(s) of studentsâ€™ lived experiences. While the range of well-being topics varies widely, previous Engelhard courses have included: adjustment and transition to college, anxiety, coping mechanisms, depression, eating disorders, emotional intelligence, healthy relationships, mindfulness, mood regulation, self-forgiveness, sexual identity, sexual violence, sleep deprivation, substance abuse, suicide, and stress.

      <p style= "padding: 15px; background-color: #eee; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px;" class="lead">
      The Engelhard Project began in 2005 as a grant supported through the Bringing Theory to Practice (BTtoP) project. A combination of faculty and student affairs staff on campus dedicated to connections between student academic experiences and broader life experiences - especially in the areas of well-being, flourishing, and mental health - were looking for innovative ways to formalize these connections. Through this initial grant funding, the project took hold at Georgetown, and following the first few years as BTtoP grant supported work, the project was endowed through a generous gift from the S. Engelhard Foundation in 2012. Today, the Engelhard Project has reached over 10,000 students in 350 courses, through the work of nearly 100 faculty members. The Engelhard Project is grateful for the support over the years from BTtoP and its co-founder, Sally Engelhard Pingree, as well as the many donors and additional university support the project has received.
