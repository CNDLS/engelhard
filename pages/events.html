      <p class="lead">
        To celebrate its tenth anniversary, The Engelhard Project hosted a series of events throughout the 2015-2016 academic year, entitled “Engelhard Conversations on Educating the Whole Person.” The goal of these events was to create space for discussion and engagement on a range of topics connected to well-being issues across the university, at all levels and inclusive of faculty, students, and staff. These conversations provided opportunities for the entire campus community to explore, reflect, and collaborate on ways to deepen our commitment to educating the whole person, one of Georgetown’s <a href="https://missionandministry.georgetown.edu/thespiritofgeorgetown/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.

Harward and Pingree were joined by Faculty Fellow Jennifer Woolard (Psychology) and former student Craig Cassey (COL ‘15), who both shared their experiences with the Engelhard Project. The panel conversation was followed by a reception, including a commemorative anniversary video and opportunities to join in community to celebrate the work of the Engelhard Project over the years.

      <h4>Well-being, Diversity, and the University Community: A Conversation with Daniel R. Porterfield (COL‘83)</h4>
      <p class="lead">
          In collaboration with the Doyle Engaging Difference Program, the Engelhard Project hosted its second conversation on November 18, 2015, with Dr. Daniel R. Porterfield (COL ‘83), President of Franklin & Marshall College, and former Senior Vice President for Strategic Development at Georgetown. Moderated by Joan B. Riley, Engelhard Senior Scholar and Associate Professor of Human Science, the talk focused on the intersection of issues of diversity and well-being on a university campus. What does it mean to be a community of higher education that honors both the individual and collective histories and identities of its students? How can we provide a welcoming environment for all students and promote well-being? Porterfield spoke about his experiences at Georgetown and Franklin & Marshall, discussing strategies he uses to shift existing culture and to support well-being.

          On March 23, 2016, the Engelhard Project hosted a day-long workshop for campus faculty and staff, featuring Dr. Marcia Baxter Magolda, a nationally recognized author and speaker on student development and learning. During her keynote address, Magolda introduced her theories on self-authorship and learning partnerships. Magolda’s remarks were followed by reflections from Vice Provost Randy Bass and Vice President for Mission and Ministry Father Kevin O’Brien, S.J., as well as a working session for participants to reflect on opportunities for integrative learning and well-being at Georgetown. Discussions centered around challenges to learning partnerships as well as finding the support and inspiration to strive towards an ideal state of student learning and development within higher education.

      <p class="lead">
          The Engelhard Project hosted its final events of the conversation series during CNDLS’ <a href="http://tlisi.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">Teaching, Learning & Innovation Summer Institute</a> in late May, bringing in guests from Gallup to lead discussions on well-being in higher education. Brandon Busteed, Executive Director of Education and Workforce Development at Gallup, gave a keynote address which focused on findings from Gallup’s well-being studies and the outcomes for students in higher education, in particular. This talk was followed by a workshop led by Jade Wood, Gallup’s Well-Being Subject Matter Expert. Participants dove deeper into the five elements of well-being and worked to find ways to thrive at Georgetown for themselves, their colleagues, and their students.
