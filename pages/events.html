      <h4>Well-being, Diversity, and the University Community: A Conversation with Daniel R. Porterfield (COL‘83)</h4>
      <p class="lead">
          In collaboration with the Doyle Engaging Difference Program, the Engelhard Project hosted its second conversation on November 18, 2015, with Dr. Daniel R. Porterfield (’83), President of Franklin & Marshall College, and former Senior Vice President for Strategic Development at Georgetown. Moderated by Joan B. Riley, Engelhard Senior Scholar and Associate Professor of Human Science, the talk focused on the issue of diversity in a community as sprawling as the university environment. What does it mean to be a community of higher education that honors both the individual and collective histories and identities of its students? How can we provide a welcoming environment for all students and promote well-being? Porterfield spoke about his experiences at Georgetown and Franklin & Marshall, discussing strategies he uses to shift existing culture and support well-being.

      <h4>Building Shared Approaches to Integrative Learning, Formation, and Well-being</h4>
      <p class="lead">
          On March 23, 2016, the Engelhard Project hosted a workshop for campus faculty and staff, featuring Dr. Marcia Baxter Magolda, a nationally recognized author and speaker on student development and learning. In her presentation, Magolda introduced her theories on self-authorship and learning partnerships. Magolda’s keynote was followed by reflections from Vice Provost Randy Bass and Father Kevin O’Brien, S.J., as well as a working session for participants to reflect on issues of integrative learning and well-being at Georgetown. Discussions centered around challenges to learning partnerships as well as finding the support and inspiration to strive towards an ideal state of student learning and development within higher education.

      <h4>Well-Being in Higher Education and in Practice: Gallup Collaboration</h4>
      <p class="lead">
          The Engelhard Project hosted its final events of the conversation series during CNDLS’ <a href="tlisi.georgetown.edu">Teaching, Learning & Innovation Summer Institute</a> in late May, bringing in guests from Gallup to lead discussions on well-being in higher education. Brandon Busteed, Executive Director of Education and Workforce Development at Gallup, gave a keynote address which focused on findings from Gallup’s well-being studies that also focus on the outcome of students in higher education. This talk was followed by a workshop led by Jade Wood, Gallup’s Well-Being Subject Matter Expert: “Well-being in Practice -- For Our Students and Ourselves.” Participants dove deeper into the elements of well-being and worked to find ways to improve well-being in their own lives and to enable and empower those around them (including students).
