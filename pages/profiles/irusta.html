<p class="lead">Pablo Irusta teaches Immunology as an Engelhard course because he believes it allows him to connect with his students on a deeper intellectual level.</p>

“Learning how cells and molecules protect us during an infection becomes more meaningful when students consider the socioeconomic, behavioral, and public health factors that frame life on and around campus,” he explains. Discussing their own health and well-being also helps students see how the science they study affects their own lives and those of the people around them.
