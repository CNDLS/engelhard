<p class="lead">Karen Stohr has taught Introduction to Ethics, a large lecture course, as an Engelhard course since 2010. Stohr wants her students to see “how ethics can help them live their lives better and make their community and their world better.” She also sees Engelhard as a tool for better learning. As she puts it, “I do [Engelhard] because I think they learn Kant better.”</p>

In a unit on community ethics, Stohr assigns readings by Immanuel Kant that raise moral problems with drunkenness and sexual objectification. Stohr then asks her students to reflect on what it takes to be fully self-respecting and fully respecting of others in the context of social life at Georgetown. Through assigned readings and a guest lecture by Jen Schweer, Associate Director for Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Services at Health Education Services (HES), Stohr brings campus life into the classroom. Through the Engelhard Project, Stohr transforms her large lecture class into a more personal experience so her students see the relevance of ethics in their own lives.
