<p class="lead">For the Engelhard component of Management and Organizational Behavior, Robert Bies asks students to view the film The Great Debaters and invites Georgetown Staff Psychologist John Wright to co-facilitate a post-film discussion.</p>

The discussion encourages students to critically examine lessons learned from the civil rights era in the U.S. and to look at how these lessons might apply to creating healthy organizations and companies. The discussion contributes to Bies’s course goals to help students “understand their moral purpose as global business leaders and make a difference in the lives of others.”
