<p class="lead">“Taking theory out to play” is Chentsova Dutton’s phrase for assignments that ask students to try out some of the more complex course concepts on themselves.</p>

For example, during a unit on stress management, she asks her students to observe and catalog their patterns of negative thoughts and examine the impact of reframing these ideas using positive thought formulation techniques. She also invites Tim Casey from Georgetown’s John Main Center for Meditation and Inter-religious Dialogue to lead students through a group meditation exercise. Chentsova Dutton believes that the Engelhard components of her class help make difficult concepts and theories more applicable and more easily understood by students.
