<p class="lead">Since 2008, Anne Rosenwald has been teaching Biology of Global Health, a sophomore-level gateway course for the Biology of Global Health major, as an Engelhard course. In the design and implementation of her course, Rosenwald embodies the Jesuit principle of cura personalis, or care of the whole person, a key goal of the Engelhard Project.</p>

To help her students examine the complex issues surrounding the treatment of terminally ill patients, Anne Rosenwald (Biology) creates a safe space for discussion, presents multiple views through guest speakers and readings, and encourages students to share personal experiences.

She begins each semester by inviting bioethicist Father Kevin FitzGerald (GUMC) to lead a discussion challenging students’ definitions of “health.” In the spring of 2015, Rosenwald invited a panel, including a psychiatrist and a chaplain, to discuss hope and its role in treatment. “Many students have experience with death, and they always think they’re the only ones. The class becomes a safe place where students can talk about these issues,” explains Rosenwald. One student noted that “many of my peers revealed their personal experiences with a dying loved one, which brought the conversation to a human level I had not experienced in a classroom setting before.” This in turn helps students understand the material: “[T]he Engelhard aspect [of the course] helped connect the sometimes abstract topics in class with real-world dilemmas,” explained another student.

Anne Rosenwald teaches her Biology of Global Health course both as a serious scientist and as a caring professor. One student summed it up simply: “While the class itself has forced me to think as a scientist, the Engelhard portion of the class has forced me to think as a human being.”
