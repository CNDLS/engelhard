title: SFS Proseminar
course: SFS Proseminar

topic:
  - Mental health and substance issues

<p class="lead">Two major themes of Betty Andrettaâ€™s Proseminar in the School of Foreign Service are class struggle and the reproduction of social inequalities in the U.S.</p>

As part of the course, students examine how issues of mental illness and substance abuse differentially affect the poor and the middle class. To deepen their exploration of this topic, Andretta brings in a campus health professional to engage students in personal reflection on mental health and substance issues in their own lives and those of their peers at Georgetown.
