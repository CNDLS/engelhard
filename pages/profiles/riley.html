<p class="lead">What began as a student project in an Engelhard course on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention has turned into a fixture of campus life, the Georgetown Campus Farmer's Market.</p>

As part of an assignment for Joan Riley’s Health Promotion and Disease Prevention course in the School of Nursing and Health Studies, students were asked to develop a proposal for a health promotion activity for Georgetown’s campus. Students Bre Donald (NHS ’12) and Melissa Gadsden (NHS ’12) created the idea for a weekly campus farmers market with the goals of making fresh, locally-grown produce more accessible to GU students, helping to educate students about healthy eating, and connecting campus life to the broader Georgetown and DC community. Donald and Gadsden’s excitement for their concept drove them to pursue their project beyond the completion of the course. Following conversations and collaboration with various campus offices and administrators, they were able to implement their idea on a trial basis starting in April 2011. The Farmers Market was very well received and has now become a weekly event on campus during the fall and spring market seasons. Each Wednesday draws dozens of faculty, staff, and students to enjoy fresh fruit and vegetables, organic produce samples, cooking demonstrations and local food stands.
