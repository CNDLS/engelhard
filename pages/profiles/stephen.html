<p class="lead">Betsi Stephenâ€™s students partner with local junior high and high school students born in other countries to document their immigrant experiences.</p>

<p>To prepare them for this community-based learning experience, her students study the effect of immigration on adolescent mental health with a Georgetown campus health professional. The reflective writing of this Engelhard course helps students to find points of connection between their own adolescent experiences and those of the younger immigrant students with whom they work.
