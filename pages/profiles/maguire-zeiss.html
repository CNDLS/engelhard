topic:
  - Sleep deprivation

<p class="lead">In this advanced neurobiology course, students connect the molecular and clinical aspects of sleep deprivation to their own sleep experiences.</p>

The clinical expertise of CAPS psychiatrists Hallie Lightdale and Sonja Lillrank helps students understand the importance of good sleep habits and how to recognize when sleep deprivation is a problem. By exploring this universal issue through an academic lens, Maguire-Zeiss creates a meaningful learning experience while also introducing students to key resources on campus.
