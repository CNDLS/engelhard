<p class="lead">Susan Lynskeyâ€™s course on the Art of the Monologue focuses on monologue as a universal activity and an expression of individual identity.</p>

As part of the course, students explore the practice of mindfulness during a ten-minute reflective period held at the beginning of each class. Together with her Engelhard Health Professional, Psychologist Matthew Schottland, Lynskey encourages deeper conversation about the practice of mindfulness and the ways in which students can invite it into their everyday lives.
