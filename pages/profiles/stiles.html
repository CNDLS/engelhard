<p class="lead">In her Engelhard course on Social Entrepeneurship, Sarah Stiles (Sociology) asks her students to commit to a personal wellness routine for the semester.</p>

In order to help her students learn to apply theories of social change and to see social entrepeneurship as a lifestyle, Engelhard Faculty Fellow Sarah Stiles asks her students to commit to a personal wellness routine&mdash;both physical and mental&mdash;during the semester. Students partner with one another as “accountability buddies” and keep journals of their progress toward their wellness goals. Additionally, students collaborate with local organizations to undertake social entrepreneurial projects, engage with real problems in the D.C. community, and apply course strategies with an eye to creating systemic and sustainable change. The students’ course experience is deeply shaped by connecting these various aspects of their lives within a single course framework. As one student put it, “this course has been able to make connections and educate me about things that no other course has been able to do [and] made me draw on all aspects of my educational experience.”
