<p class="lead">The Health Studies Colloquium provides all new students in the School of Nursing and Health Studies with an overview of the many personal and academic opportunities available to them at Georgetown.</p>

Joan Riley and other Engelhard Faculty Fellows have further strengthened the first-year student experience by weaving health and wellness themes into the course. One of the most powerful Engelhard components is a collaboration with Georgetown Staff Psychologist Afshin Nili. Using an anonymous survey, students answer questions about the issues they are grappling with at Georgetown, such as being away from home for the first time and fitting in. Class discussion of the survey responses with advice and ideas from Dr. Nili normalizes students’ struggles in a powerful way. As one student noted: “Through this class, I found out many things about myself and was able to make changes that will benefit me for the next four years, and probably even beyond.”
