topic:
  - Identity, stigma, and social inequality

<p class="lead">Sarah Stiles introduces her students to the concept of deviance, the pyscho-social impact of being different and treating people differently. They learn that deviance can mean a slight variation from the norm, and that the stigma that goes along with it can be extremely burdensome.</p>

Engelhard Health Professional Dr. John Wright (CAPS) takes students through varying scenarios of hypothetical Georgetown students who feel different in some way and describes the impact that the Georgetown culture can have on someone who feels outside the norm. Throughout this process, students become aware of perspectives they may not have previously considered, and those students who may identify with the hypothetical characters find courage to participate in the discussion.
