<p class="lead">In his class on math modeling, Jim Sandefur incorporates data sets involving nutrition, gambling, and alcohol.</p>

As he explains, “the Engelhard Project fit right into what I have always wanted to do. For years, I had been looking for engaging models that were important to the students, where they could see math as it affected their lives.” Partnering with campus health staff has deepened Sandefur’s understanding of these issues and has equipped him to help students who were struggling, while pushing all of the students to think about their actions in new ways. Sandefur has consistently noticed that his students not only understand the math better, but enjoy it more. By demonstrating concrete ways to use new math skills, the course extends beyond the classroom walls into the students’ personal lives.
