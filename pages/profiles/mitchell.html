<p class="lead">In this course on Biblical Literature, Alan Mitchell explores his studentsâ€™ experiences of friendship as a means to shaping a healthy social identity and encourages them to consider how friendship can act both as a bond and as a barrier.</p>

Students not only reflect on wellness and friendship with a new perspective, but they are also able to see the connections between their own lives and those they are studying in the Biblical texts.
