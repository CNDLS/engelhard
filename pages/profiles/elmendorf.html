<p class="lead">Heidi Elmendorf personalizes her large introductory course by sharing her own experience with depression and incorporating a conversation with Director of Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS), Phil Meilman.</p>

She then administers an anonymous student survey about mental health, which students further explore in an online discussion format. Inspired and empowered by the discussion, each student chooses a topic for an independent research paper, connecting academic content to issues that they or their peers have experienced. With this meaningful assignment, Elemendorf hopes to help students “gain a sense of comfort as a community” and to provide them with “unexpected resources for coping.”
