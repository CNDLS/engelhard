  - Resilience, coping and self-forgiveness in young adults

<p class="lead">By bringing in Georgetown Staff Psychologist John Wright to discuss the topics of resilience and self-forgiveness, Sarah Vittone emphasizes to her students that these are necessary components of human development.</p>

<p>The reflective writing required in every Engelhard course gives Vittone an opportunity to ask her students about their ability to cope with the stresses of college life. She finds that this reflective exercise helps students to pause and see themselves in what they are learning, creating more connection between course concepts and their own lives. She hopes that the stress-relieving techniques introduced in class help students to handle both their academic workload and their clinical work with patients.
