As part of the coursework in Theatre as Social Change, taught by Natsu Onoda Power (Performing Arts) and Carol Day (Human Science), Georgetown students work with an after-school group of Ballou High School students to develop, write, and perform a high school play. One of the underlying goals of this collaboration is to explore ways to use the performance as a platform to discuss and explore solutions to social issues that concern the high school student community. In past semesters, the plays have included such issues as depression, suicidality, substance abuse, and homophobia along with many forms of peer pressure the Ballou students face.
 
Professors Onoda Power and Day use the course meeting time to explore the theories and concepts of performance art as social activism as well as to support the Georgetown students in their multiple roles within the course. Georgetown students, while still being students themselves, are also taking on roles as mentors, co-collaborators, peers, instructors, and guests. The Engelhard aspect of this course creates the structure and space for students to reflect on and process their experiences in the community, seek out support when necessary, and further strengthen an already powerful learning experience.
