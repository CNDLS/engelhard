<p class="lead">Jen Woolard (Psychology) has been teaching Community Psychology as an Engelhard course since the program’s inception in 2005.</p>

As she explains, community psychologists “combine theory, research, and action to promote health and prevent problems in communities, groups, and individuals.” To prepare students to analyze unfamiliar communities, Woolard challenges students to map their own social support networks and reflect on each network’s breadth, depth, and accessibility. Through Engelhard, she also hopes to teach her students about resources in the GU community available to support their own health.
