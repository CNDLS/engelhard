title: Wellbeing Workshop Series

<div>
	<p class="lead">
		The Engelhard Project, in collaboration with Counseling and Psychiatric Service (CAPS), Health Education Services (HES), and Cawley Career Education Center, offers our Wellbeing Workshop Series for students, staff, and faculty.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Wellbeing Workshop Series was created in the fall semester of 2020 as another resource for the Georgetown community for engaging in topics of wellbeing. Our workshops focus on skillbuilding across a range of topics. While primarily focused on our student audience, anyone is welcome to attend and recordings of most of the sessions are available to view after the session.

	<p>
		Below are our workshops for this semester and recordings from past semesters. Please join us in these virtual conversations with campus resource partners and other students about approaches to supporting each other and our wellbeing.
