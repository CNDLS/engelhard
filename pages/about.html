			The Engelhard Project for Connecting Life and Learning began in 2005, supported by a grant from the Bringing Theory to Practice (BTtoP) Project, awarded to a group of Georgetown faculty and student affairs staff. This group was interested in exploring — and making explicit — connections between students' academic studies and their broader life experiences, especially in the areas of well-being, flourishing, and mental health. Implementing the innovative curriculum infusion approach, the Project took hold at Georgetown.

			After the first few years with BTtoP grant support, the Project was endowed through a generous gift from the Charles Engelhard Foundation in 2012. Today, the Engelhard Project has worked with 100+ faculty and 50+ campus resource professionals on over 500 courses, with a combined student enrollment of over 19,200. The Engelhard Project is grateful for the support over the years from BTtoP and its co-founder, Sally Engelhard Pingree, as well as the support the project has received from additional donors and the University.

			Currently, the Engelhard Project supports the integration of well-being issues in courses across the University, and has expanded to include two grants programs and a faculty conversation series on teaching. The Project continues to think innovatively at the intersections of well-being, teaching, and learning-- and we look forward to exploring these spaces alongside our faculty and staff partners across the university.
