title: Engelhard Evidence of Impact Grants Criteria

<div>

       <p>We invite research project proposals from faculty and staff working within the Project to explore the impacts of their Engelhard course(s). Proposed projects can focus on student well-being, student learning, faculty experience, teaching and learning, campus community, or any Engelhard-related goal of your course. Preference will be given to proposals from interdisciplinary and/or cross-campus groups that could include faculty, campus resource fellows, and/or students. For the 2018-19 academic year we will award up to $10,000 total (with additional support from the Engelhard project team) between 3 to 6 projects.</p>
         
        <p>Please submit your proposal <b>by 5 pm on 9/5 </b>to <a href="mailto:engelhardproject@georgetown.edu">EngelhardProject@georgetown.edu</a>.
