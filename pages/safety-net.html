title: Safety Net Training

<div>
	<p class="lead">
		Georgetown University maintains a robust â€œsafety net" to support students by helping to connect them to resources that may be beneficial for their success. The safety net includes a range of offices and resources across campus.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an orientation to recognizing students of concern and the resources available to them at Georgetown, the Engelhard Project collaborates with the Division of Student Affairs through Student Outreach and Support, Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS), and Health Education Services to offer Safety Net Training workshops for staff and faculty. Each semester, new Engelhard Faculty Fellows, Campus Resource Partners and/or Teaching Assistants are encouraged to attend a Safety Net Training. To learn about the next Safety Net Training, contact a member of the Project Team or email us at <a href="mailto:engelhardproject@georgetown.edu">engelhardproject@georgetown.edu</a>.

	<p>The Division of Student Affairs, in conjunction with other campus partners, has developed a <a href="https://georgetown.box.com/s/ql0w63qxz78tv3hltasxb6vozowblzf3" target="__blank">Faculty and Staff Resource Guide</a>. This guide was created primarily to aid faculty and staff in assisting students experiencing various levels of distress. Although not an exhaustive guide, it provides some general guiding principles in assisting students in distress.</p>
