<h4>Adapting My Course for Engelhard</h4>
<p>I've been teaching Problem of God now for three years. This was my first year including an Engelhard component into the course and was different than in semesters past. What changed in this course [when joining the Engelhard Project] was the incorporation of the Engelhard component in a very visceral way, where class time was devoted [to personal discussion]. In these discussions, students were encouraged to share challenges in their education and in their life here on campus.</p>
<p>An element of these discussions were the religious concepts we encounter in class. In previous semesters, the groups might arrive at an academic conclusion then move on to discuss more personal, everyday things. Having this intentionality of incorporating their life on campus changed the group dynamic. Groups began sharing more of their personal struggles and finding friendship and strength in that sharing. I coupled this component with a version of an Ignatian examen in which they reflected on these topics in class. In these exercises, I would give them a prompt for personal thought and they would take five to ten minutes to discuss it in a group. It was profound how much that time for discussion impacted the students.</p>
<br>
<h4>What changed?</h4>
<p>The vast majority of my students are first-semester freshmen. They are trying to figure out who they are and where they are. In speaking about personal matters with each other, they became more comfortable challenging each other, and did so because they had formed a base trust level. Since they have base trust, someone in class would volunteer their perspective on a topic and someone would argue it immediately in a way I used to have to coax out [from students]. Then, because the course content itself is dealing with sort of existential matters, I think that kind of grappling became more intimate in our groups. People would say things like, "God is this, but I don't understand this,” or "I don't believe in God, but I can see why there's value in this." Lowering these boundaries between people, opening them up to others’ sensitivities, to each other's needs and interests, strengthened the course in a way I didn't expect.</p>
<p>One of the surprising things even for me was watching the way the Engelhard content snuck up as something very meaningful. Initially, the attitude among students felt [reluctant]. "Oh look, the dude in the collar is making us do something touchy-feely and sort of religious, I guess we'll humor him.” But over the course of the semester, this might transition into something like “I actually really needed [the reflection] that one time, so maybe there's something to this." For my class, this realization fits right into the course material. Right around the time they have a sneaking suspicion there might be something substantial to the form of the class, they read about William James and the varieties of religious experience, or they talk about Abraham Maslow and the hierarchy of needs. All of the sudden, this stuff starts to connect. This isn't just intellectual stuff! It’s significant stuff for all people to wrestle with. I think that the students who are most resistant to it are often surprised by how the arching connection eventually gets made.</p>
<br>
<h4>So… why does community matter?</h4>
<p> Fostering community should matter for anyone who's doing residential education. We have students who live in residence halls. Clearly, we seem to believe that being a community is important for learning. If it were just content that mattered, we'd hand them a couple of books and tell them to go [online]. If education at its best is dialogical, they have to have an open dialogue with one another, finding the safety to openly challenge their base assumptions. This is especially the case when we're talking about something as deep as one's existential grounding.</p>
<p>I am hoping that by incorporating the Ignatian principles and using the Engelhard part of this as the "hook," I am establishing what Jesuit education looks like—such that [students] walk away [saying], "This is how Georgetown is special and different; because I had a professor who actually took time to ask us where we were finding resistance and affirmation on campus."</p>
