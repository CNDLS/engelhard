title: Engelhard Conversations on Teaching

<div>
  <p class="lead">Engelhard Faculty Conversations on Teaching aim to create a small community of colleagues for deep exploration of various topics that relate to teaching and well-being, and foster connections with each other around the work we do here at Georgetown. Started in the Fall of 2017 with the “Teaching to Mission” Conversation group, our Faculty Conversations have now expanded to two different conversation groups, “Teaching to Mission” and “Inclusivity and Well-Being.” </p>
